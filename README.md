This game turns the concept of 2d platforming on its head, what seem like simple platforming levels are made all the more complex as your only source of movement is a flipper!!

This game uses <b>physics-based systems</b> where the player controls a paddle that can collide with a character. This character can then be hit with the paddle to reach the end of the level.

<b>How the paddle is utilised is up to the player.</b>
